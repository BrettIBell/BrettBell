I am currently an eighth year MD/PhD candidate in the Medical Scientist Training Program at the <a href="https://einsteinmed.edu">Albert Einstein College of Medicine</a>. I have defended my PhD thesis in Pathology and am now completing my clinical training.

I am a 2018 <i>magna cum laude</i> graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, where I received both a Bachelor of Arts in Biochemistry and Biology, with distinction in both majors, and a Master of Science in Chemistry. While at Penn, I conducted research under the mentorship of Dr. Constantinos Koumenis into the role of Interleukin-6 in acute and delayed gastrointestinal toxicity using a novel mouse model of focal image-guided irradiation.

For my thesis research, I joined the laboratory of Dr. Chandan Guha in the Department of Radiation Oncology to study how the physical characteristics of radiation can alter its biological effects. I investigated the impact of radiation energy on hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, and immunologic injury using orthovoltage X-rays and <sup>137</sup>Cs Î³-rays and identified an energy dependence of RBE using modern preclinical irradiators. In collaboration with the New York Proton Center, I studied the effects of pencil beam scanned FLASH proton therapy on gastrointestinal toxicity. Furthermore, I have coordinated multi-institutional collaborations with the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the  Heidelberger Ionenstrahl Therapiezentrum to elucidate the immunologic consequences of carbon ion radiotherapy in pancreatic cancer. I am currently funded by an NCI Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (<a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/kMBNhyAn4USkCjOfvM2qrA/project-details/10751872">F30CA278322</a>).
